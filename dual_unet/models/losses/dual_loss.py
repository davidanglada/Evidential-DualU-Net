    A dual-purpose loss function that combines a segmentation loss (Cross-Entropy + Dice)

      - Segmentation predictions are trained via a weighted combination of:
          * CrossEntropyLoss
          * DiceLoss (with optional class weights)
      - Gaussian centroid predictions are trained via MSELoss.

        ce_weights (torch.Tensor): Class weights for the CrossEntropyLoss.
        weight_dice (float): Weight factor for the Dice loss term.
        weight_dice_b (float): [Currently unused in the code, but kept for possible expansions].
        weight_ce (float): Weight factor for the CrossEntropyLoss term.
        weight_mse (float): Weight factor for the MSELoss term.
